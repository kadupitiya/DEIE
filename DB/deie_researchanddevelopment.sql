The purpose of my experiment was to find out if salt water rusts nails faster than freshwater and which type of nails, galvanized or common will rust quickly.The procedure involved sanding ten galvanized and common nails.The nails were placed in glass jars and added with 150mL of water mixed with 15mL of salt. The experiment was observed for two weeks. Theamount of rust was recorded on both types of nails. I repeated these steps for two types of nails in freshwater. My results of my data resolves that galvanized and common nails in freshwater had a higher average or rust than the other nails in salt water. My data also concludes that the rusting color was black. In conslusion the nails in frehwater rusted more than the nails in saltwater. Saltwater may rust something faster than freshwater, but salt contains sodium chloride in which it causes the nails in saltwater to rust at a slower rate.','www.websiteLink.com','RF Energy, Energy Harvesting, Patch Antenna, Voltage Multiplier, Pi Matching.','Mr. Kumara M.U.G , Ms. Sewwandi P.S   , Mr. Tennakoon T.M.P , Mr. Wickramapala D.B','2010-10-12',1,0,'I will be researching on the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL).

My results of my data resolves that galvanized and common nails in freshwater had a higher average or rust than the other nails in salt water. My data also concludes that the rusting color was black. In conslusion the nails in frehwater rusted more than the nails in saltwater. Saltwater may rust something faster than freshwater, but salt contains sodium chloride in which it causes the nails in saltwater to rust at a slower rate.','www.websiteLink.com','RF Energy, Energy Harvesting, Patch Antenna, Voltage Multiplier, Pi Matching.','Mr. Kumara M.U.G , Ms. Sewwandi P.S   , Mr. Tennakoon T.M.P , Mr. Wickramapala D.B','2010-10-12',1,0,'I will be researching on the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL).

The purpose of my experiment was to find out if salt water rusts nails faster than freshwater and which type of nails, galvanized or common will rust quickly.The procedure involved sanding ten galvanized and common nails.The nails were placed in glass jars and added with 150mL of water mixed with 15mL of salt. The experiment was observed for two weeks. Theamount of rust was recorded on both types of nails. I repeated these steps for two types of nails in freshwater. My results of my data resolves that galvanized and common nails in freshwater had a higher average or rust than the other nails in salt water. My data also concludes that the rusting color was black. In conslusion the nails in frehwater rusted more than the nails in saltwater.
